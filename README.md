Hi! I made an official website for a clinic back at my country, so the content is all in mandarin! I hope it's okay! For the time being, I am unable to get decent photos of the clinic so all of the photos/color-coding on the site are placeholder images I got from unsplash.com.<br>
The website contains 5 sections:
<ul>
<li>A banner that currently contains a placeholder image.</li>
<li>An about the clinic section which includes:
<ul>
<li>Offered treatment with a placeholder image on the left.</li>
<li>Equipped medical devices, shown in tiles on desktop modes and carousel in mobile device mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A time schedule  section of the clinic and which doctor is in charge.</li>
<li>A map and commute option section.</li>
<li>A doctor information section.</li>
</ul> 

I hope this is detailed enough of a description for you to understand the website! Thank you!
